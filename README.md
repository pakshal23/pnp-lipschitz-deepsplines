# PnP Image Reconstruction Using Lipschitz-Constrained Deep Spline Neural Networks
This repository contains the code related to the paper "Learning Lipschitz-Controlled Activation Functions in Neural Networks for Plug-and-Play Image Reconstruction Methods" [[paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=efCsbTzQTbH)].

Requirements
------------------
* PyTorch
* [Pylops-GPU](https://github.com/PyLops/pylops-gpu) (for reconstruction using total-variation regularization)
